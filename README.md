# my-first-game
This is code for my first game a 2 player Pong game in Python using the Pygame library. It imports Pygame and other necessary modules like sys, random, and math. Pygame handles the graphics and game loop. It defines functions for the major game mechanics like ball_animation(), player_animation(), opponent_animation(), and ball start(). These handle moving the ball, paddles, restarting after a score, etc.  In the main game loop, it checks for input events like key presses to move the player paddle. Each frame it runs the animation functions to update positions and check for collisions, scores. It draws the game objects like the ball, paddles, background, scores, and center line. There are variables keeping track of things like score, ball speed, paddle speeds. It plays sounds for bounces and scores using Pygame mixer. Overall it has the typical game loop pattern of input handling, game logic updates, rendering, and repeating.The code handles the basics of a Pong game like moving objects, collisions, scoring, and sound.
